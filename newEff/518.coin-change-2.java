 * Testcase Example:  '5\n[1,2,5]'
 *
 * You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money.
 * Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that
 * amount. You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin.
 * 
 * Note: You can assume that
 * 
 * 
 * 0 <= amount <= 5000
 * 1 <= coin <= 5000
 * the number of coins is less than 500
 * the answer is guaranteed to fit into signed 32-bit integer
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
 * 5=5
 * 5=2+2+1
 * 5=2+1+1+1
 * 5=1+1+1+1+1
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: amount = 10, coins = [10] 
 * Output: 1
