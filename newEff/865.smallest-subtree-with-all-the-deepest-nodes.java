 *
 * Given a binary tree rooted at root, the depth of each node is the shortest
 * distance to the root.
 * 
 * A node is deepest if it has the largest depth possible among any node in the
 * entire tree.
 * 
 * The subtree of a node is that node, plus the set of all descendants of that
 * node.
 * 
 * Return the node with the largest depth such that it contains all the deepest
 * nodes in its subtree.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]
 * Output: [2,7,4]
 * Explanation:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * We return the node with value 2, colored in yellow in the diagram.
 * The nodes colored in blue are the deepest nodes of the tree.
 * The input "[3, 5, 1, 6, 2, 0, 8, null, null, 7, 4]" is a serialization of
 * the given tree.
 * The output "[2, 7, 4]" is a serialization of the subtree rooted at the node
 * with value 2.
 * Both the input and output have TreeNode type.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * The number of nodes in the tree will be between 1 and 500.
 * The values of each node are unique.
