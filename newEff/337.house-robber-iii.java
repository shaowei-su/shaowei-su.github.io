 * Testcase Example:  '[3,2,3,null,3,null,1]'
 *
 * The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is
 * only one entrance to this area, called the "root." Besides the root, each
 * house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief
 * realized that "all houses in this place forms a binary tree". It will
 * automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken
 * into on the same night.
 * 
 * Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without
 * alerting the police.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]
 * 
 * ⁠    3
 * ⁠   / \
 * ⁠  2   3
 * ⁠   \   \ 
 * ⁠    3   1
 * 
 * Output: 7 
 * Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]
 * 
 * 3
 * ⁠   / \
 * ⁠  4   5
 * ⁠ / \   \ 
 * ⁠1   3   1
 * 
 * Output: 9
 * Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.
