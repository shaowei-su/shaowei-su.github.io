 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2,5]\n11'
 *
 * You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money
 * amount. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need
 * to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any
 * combination of the coins, return -1.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11
 * Output: 3 
 * Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
 * Output: -1
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.
