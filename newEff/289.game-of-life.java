 * According to the Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply
 * as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John
 * Horton Conway in 1970."
 * 
 * Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an initial state live (1) or
 * dead (0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal,
 * vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above
 * Wikipedia article):
 * 
 * 
 * Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by
 * under-population.
 * Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next
 * generation.
 * Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by
 * over-population..
 * Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if
 * by reproduction.
 * 
 * 
 * Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board
 * given its current state. The next state is created by applying the above
 * rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and
 * deaths occur simultaneously.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: 
 * [
 * [0,1,0],
 * [0,0,1],
 * [1,1,1],
 * [0,0,0]
 * ]
 * Output: 
 * [
 * [0,0,0],
 * [1,0,1],
 * [0,1,1],
 * [0,1,0]
 * ]
 * 
 * 
 * Follow up:
 * 
 * 
 * Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated at
 * the same time: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated
 * values to update other cells.
 * In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the
 * board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area
 * encroaches the border of the array. How would you address these problems?
 *
