title: Leetcode[284] Peeking Iterator
---
###Task1
Given an Iterator class interface with methods: next() and hasNext(), design and implement a PeekingIterator that support the peek() operation -- it essentially peek() at the element that will be returned by the next call to next().

Here is an example. Assume that the iterator is initialized to the beginning of the list: [1, 2, 3].

Call next() gets you 1, the first element in the list.

Now you call peek() and it returns 2, the next element. Calling next() after that still return 2.

You call next() the final time and it returns 3, the last element. Calling hasNext() after that should return false.

Hint:

	Think of "looking ahead". You want to cache the next element.
	Is one variable sufficient? Why or why not?
	Test your design with call order of peek() before next() vs next() before peek().
	For a clean implementation, check out Google's guava library source code.
Follow up: How would you extend your design to be generic and work with all types, not just integer?

###Python
```python
# Below is the interface for Iterator, which is already defined for you.
#
# class Iterator(object):
#     def __init__(self, nums):
#         """
#         Initializes an iterator object to the beginning of a list.
#         :type nums: List[int]
#         """
#
#     def hasNext(self):
#         """
#         Returns true if the iteration has more elements.
#         :rtype: bool
#         """
#
#     def next(self):
#         """
#         Returns the next element in the iteration.
#         :rtype: int
#         """

class PeekingIterator(object):
    def __init__(self, iterator):
        """
        Initialize your data structure here.
        :type iterator: Iterator
        """
        self.iterator = iterator
        self.cached = False

    def peek(self):
        """
        Returns the next element in the iteration without advancing the iterator.
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not self.cached:
            self.cache = self.iterator.next()
            self.cached = True
        return self.cache
        

    def next(self):
        """
        :rtype: int
        """
        if self.cached:
            self.cached = False
            return self.cache
        return self.iterator.next()
        

    def hasNext(self):
        """
        :rtype: bool
        """
        return self.iterator.hasNext() or self.cached

# Your PeekingIterator object will be instantiated and called as such:
# iter = PeekingIterator(Iterator(nums))
# while iter.hasNext():
#     val = iter.peek()   # Get the next element but not advance the iterator.
#     iter.next()         # Should return the same value as [val].


###Java
```java
// Java Iterator interface reference:
// https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html
class PeekingIterator implements Iterator<Integer> {

    Integer cache;
    Iterator<Integer> itr;
	public PeekingIterator(Iterator<Integer> iterator) {
	    // initialize any member here.
	    this.itr = iterator;
	    this.cache = itr.next();
	}

    // Returns the next element in the iteration without advancing the iterator.
	public Integer peek() {
        return cache;
	}

	// hasNext() and next() should behave the same as in the Iterator interface.
	// Override them if needed.
	@Override
	public Integer next() {
	    int res = cache;
	    cache = itr.hasNext() ? itr.next() : null;
	    return res;
	}

	@Override
	public boolean hasNext() {
	    return cache != null || itr.hasNext();
	}
}
```

###Points
	本题目考察设计模式中的装饰器模式（Decorator Pattern）
	
	参阅维基百科Decorator Pattern词条：https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern
	
	In object-oriented programming, the decorator pattern (also known as Wrapper, an alternative naming shared with the Adapter pattern) is a design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. The decorator pattern is often useful for adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle, as it allows functionality to be divided between classes with unique areas of concern.
	
	引入两个额外的变量nextElement和peekFlag
	
	nextElement标识peek操作预先获取的下一个元素，peekFlag记录当前是否已经执行过peek操作
	
	若已知所有元素非空，不使用peekFlag变量也可，参考：https://leetcode.com/discuss/59327/my-java-solution
	
	关于进一步思考，使用Java的泛型可以适用于所有的类型。
	
	具体实现详见代码
