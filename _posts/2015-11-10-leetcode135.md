title: Leetcode[135] Candy
---
###Task1
There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
What is the minimum candies you must give?
###Python
```python
class Solution(object):
    def candy(self, ratings):
        """
        :type ratings: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        N = len(ratings)
        ret = [1 for i in range(N)]
        for i in range(1, N):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]:
                ret[i] = ret[i - 1] + 1
        for i in range(N - 2, -1, -1):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]:
                ret[i] = max(ret[i], ret[i + 1] + 1)
        return sum(ret)
```
###Java

```java
public class Solution {
    public int candy(int[] ratings) {
        if (ratings == null || ratings.length == 0) {
        	return 0;
        }
        int res = 0;
        int[] candies = new int[ratings.length];
        candies[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < ratings.length; i++) {
        	if (ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]) {
        		candies[i] = candies[i - 1] + 1;
        	} else {
        		candies[i] = 1;
        	}
        }

        res = candies[candies.length - 1];
        for (int i = candies.length - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        	int crt = 1;
        	if (ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]) {
        		crt = candies[i + 1] + 1;
        	}

        	res += Math.max(crt, candies[i]);
        	candies[i] = crt;
        }

        return res;
    }
}

```

###Points

* O(n)
* Two pointers? Two pass: first pass ensures that left side conform to the rule; second pass ensures not only the right side also conform to the rule but also maintain the result from first pass. In other words:

		ret[i] = max(ret[i], ret[i + 1] + 1)
