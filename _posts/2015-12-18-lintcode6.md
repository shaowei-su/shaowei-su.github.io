###Task1
Example
Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of steps required to convert word1 to word2. (each operation is counted as 1 step.)

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:

	Insert a character
	Delete a character
	Replace a character

Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
Example
Given word1 = "mart" and word2 = "karma", return 3.

###Java
```java
public class Solution {
    /**
     * @param word1 & word2: Two string.
     * @return: The minimum number of steps.
     */
    public int minDistance(String word1, String word2) {
        // write your code here
        int n = word1.length();
        int m = word2.length();
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][m + 1];
        dp[0][0] = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = i;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i <= m; i++) {
            dp[0][i] = i;
        }
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
                if (word1.charAt(i - 1) == word2.charAt(j - 1)) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i - 1][j - 1], Math.min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])) + 1;
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[n][m];
    }
}
```

	if x == y, then dp[i][j] == dp[i-1][j-1]
	if x != y, and we insert y for word1, then dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + 1
	if x != y, and we delete x for word1, then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + 1
	if x != y, and we replace x with y for word1, then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
	When x!=y, dp[i][j] is the min of the three situations.
