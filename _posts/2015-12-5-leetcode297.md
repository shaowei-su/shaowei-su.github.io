title: Leetcode[297] Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree
---
###Task1
Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

For example, you may serialize the following tree

	    1
	   / \
	  2   3
	     / \	     
	    4   5
	    
as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]", just the same as how LeetCode OJ serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

Note: Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.

###Java
```java
class MedianFinder {
    class MyComparator implements Comparator<Integer> {
        @Override
        public int compare(Integer i1, Integer i2) {
            return i2.compareTo(i1);
        }
    }
    private PriorityQueue<Integer> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<Integer>();
    private PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<Integer>(new MyComparator());
    // Adds a number into the data structure.
    public void addNum(int num) {
        if (minHeap.size() == maxHeap.size()) {
            if (minHeap.peek() != null && num > minHeap.peek()) {
                maxHeap.offer(minHeap.poll());
                minHeap.offer(num);
            } else {
                maxHeap.offer(num);
            }
        } else {
            if (num < maxHeap.peek()) {
                minHeap.offer(maxHeap.poll());
                maxHeap.offer(num);
            } else {
                minHeap.offer(num);
            }
        }
    }

    // Returns the median of current data stream
    public double findMedian() {
        if (minHeap.size() == maxHeap.size()) {
            return (double) (minHeap.peek() + maxHeap.peek()) / 2;
        } else {
            return (double) maxHeap.peek();
        }
    }
};

// Your MedianFinder object will be instantiated and called as such:
// MedianFinder mf = new MedianFinder();
// mf.addNum(1);
// mf.findMedian();
```

###Points
* maxHeap contains small number so maxHeap.peek() will return the largest number in the small group and vice versa. 
* in this design, maxHeap is not smaller than the minHeap. (easier implemented)
